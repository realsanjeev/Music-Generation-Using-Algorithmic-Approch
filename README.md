# Music-Generation-Using-Algorithmic-Approch
The goal of this project is to generate music by imitating the frequency distribution of a tone matrix using an algorithmic approach.

## Get Started with Project
The following libraries are required to run this project: `opencv`, `numpy`, `music21` and `matplotlib`.
### OpenCV
To install the `opencv` package in your environment, run the following command:
```
pip intall opencv-python
```
If you are running the code in a Github codebase, you may need to install the `opencv-python-headless` package instead.

OpenCV is used to load an image and resize it to 16x16 pixels to perform further calculations in image.

### numpy
To install the `numpy` package in your environment, run the following command:
```
pip intall numpy
```
Numpy is used to do calculation and operation in matrix. 

### Music21
Music21 is a key component when processing music in symbolic representation. In this project, we will be creating a MIDI file using the Music21 library.
